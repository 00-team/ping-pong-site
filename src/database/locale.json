His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.[8] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[7][9] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[10][11] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[12][13] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[12] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[14] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as 'a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.'[14] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[10][15]",
